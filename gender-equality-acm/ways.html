      <h5 style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">Gender equality is essential for ensuring equal opportunities for all individuals regardless of their gender. By promoting fairness and justice, gender equality enables everyone to reach their full potential and contribute meaningfully to society.
      <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, gender equality fosters economic growth and development. When women and men have equal access to education, employment, and entrepreneurship opportunities, it leads to increased productivity and innovation, benefiting entire communities and nations.
      <br>
      <br>
      Gender equality also plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals. By empowering women and girls and ensuring their rights are respected, we can address various global challenges, including poverty, hunger, and climate change.
      <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, gender equality promotes social cohesion and reduces inequalities. By challenging stereotypes and discriminatory practices, we create a more inclusive and harmonious society where diversity is celebrated, and everyone is valued for who they are.
      <br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, gender equality is not just a women's issue; it's a human rights issue that requires the collective efforts of individuals, communities, and institutions. By working together to promote gender equality, we can build a more just, equitable, and sustainable world for future generations.
      <br>
      <br>
      International commitments to advance gender equality have brought about improvements in some areas: child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) have declined in recent years, and women’s representation in the political arena is higher than ever before. But the promise of a world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality, and where all legal, social, and economic barriers to their empowerment have been removed, remains unfulfilled. In fact, that goal is probably even more distant than before, since women and girls are being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.</h5></div>

        Furthermore, gender equality promotes social cohesion and reduces inequalities. By challenging stereotypes and discriminatory practices, we create a more inclusive and harmonious society where diversity is celebrated, and everyone is valued for their unique contributions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ultimately, gender equality is a fundamental human right. It is not just about women's rights but about creating a world where all individuals, regardless of gender, can live with dignity, freedom, and equal opportunities. Achieving gender equality requires the collective efforts of individuals, communities, and institutions to build a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for everyone.</h5></div>

    <div class="popuptext" id="popup3"><h5 class="center" style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">We can do</h5><span class="close">&times;</span>
      <h5 style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">If you are a girl, you can stay in school, help empower your female classmates to do the same and fight for your right to access sexual and reproductive health services. If you are a woman, you can address unconscious biases and implicit associations that form an unintended and often an invisible barrier to equal opportunity.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you are a man or a boy, you can work alongside women and girls to achieve gender equality and embrace healthy, respectful relationships.
      <br>
      <br>
      You can fund education campaigns to curb cultural practices like female genital mutilation and change harmful laws that limit the rights of women and girls and prevent them from achieving their full potential.

      The Spotlight Initiative is an EU/UN partnership, and a global, multi-year initiative focused on eliminating all forms of violence</h5></div>

      <!--popiptext4-->
    <div class="popuptext" id="popup4"><h5 class="center" style="font-size: medium; font-weight: bold;">Things can do</h5><span class="close">&times;</span>
      <h5 style="font-size: small; font-style: italic;">1. Women earn 10 to 30 per cent less than men for the same work. Pay inequality persists everywhere. Voice your support for equal pay for equal work.
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Be aware of gender stereotypes. Recognize them, avoid them and educate others about them.
      <br>
      <br>
      3. Find a Goal 5 charity you want to support. Any donation, big or small, can make a difference!
      <br>
      <br>
      4. Stand up against harassment. Whenever you see or become aware of harassment, whether in the workplace, streets, home or the online space, raise your voice against it.
      <br>
      <br>
      5. Share the workload at home. Sharing domestic responsibilities ensures the work burden doesn’t fall only on one person and instills the value of gender equality and essential life skills in children.
      <br>
      <br>
      6. Find female mentors/leaders. Ensure that some of your role models or mentors are women. There’s a lot you can learn from women in positions of authority.
